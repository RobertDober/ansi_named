**N.B.**

This README contains the docstrings and doctests from the code by means of [extractly](https://hex.pm/packages/extractly)
and the following code examples are therefor verified with `ExUnit` doctests.

Add common color names to the already existing ones in IO.ANSI

The most basic usage is to get the color code of a color name which can then be used in
IO.Color

    iex(0)> ColorNamed.ansi_color(:indigo)
    {54}

Which can then be used with IO.ANSI, however there is a more convenient function

    iex(1)> ColorNamed.ansi_code(:indigo)
    IO.ANSI.color(54)

If your terminal supports it you can also use RGB values, like so

    iex(2)> ColorNamed.rgb_code("#f9a602")
    "[38;5;249;166;2m"

with all of the HTML color names available

      iex(3)> ColorNamed.html_color("Gold")
      {255, 215, 0}

which, then, of course can be plugged into `rgb_code` again

    iex(4)> ColorNamed.rgb_code("Gold")
    "[38;5;255;215;0m"

Other color name spaces might follow


Return a list of all defined ansi_color_names
    iex(800)> ansi_color_names() |> Enum.take(3)
    ~w[ black maroon toad_in_love ]

Return a list of all defined html_color_names

    iex(906)> html_color_names() |> Enum.take(3)
    ~w[IndianRed LightCoral Salmon]
